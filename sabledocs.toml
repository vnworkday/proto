# The following 3 fields configure the source control repository of the project.

# code. By default these fields are not configured, and source code links are not included in the docs.
# The repository-type field supports two possible values, "github" and "bitbucket".
# The fields repository-url and repository-branch should be configured to point to the correct repository.
# repository-dir should be set only if the root of your Protobuf module is in a specific directory inside your repository.

# definitions will be preserved.

# were listed in the input when `protoc` was executed.
