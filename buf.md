## About VN Workday

## About this repository

At VN Workday, we use `protobuf` to define the data structures that are used in our application. `protobuf` is a
language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It is widely used in the
industry for defining
data structures and messages.

There are several benefits to using `protobuf` at VN Workday:

- **Efficiency**: `protobuf` is a binary format that is more efficient than other text-based formats like JSON or XML.
- **Performance**: `protobuf` is designed for performance and is faster to parse and serialize than other formats.
- **Interoperability**: `protobuf` is language-neutral and platform-neutral, so it can be used across different
  programming languages and platforms.
- **Code Generation**: `protobuf` comes with code generation tools that can automatically generate code for serializing
  and deserializing data structures.
- **Documentation**: `protobuf` schemas can be used to generate documentation for the data structures, making it easier
  for developers to understand and use the data.

This repository contains the `protobuf` schemas that are used in the VN Workday application. The schemas define the data
structures that are used in the application, such as user profiles, time entries, and tasks.
